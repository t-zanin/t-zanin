# Data Science Project
|    Project Title  | Code / Notebook    | Technologies    | Overview  | 
| ------------        | ------------        | ------------ |------------ |
| **Churn Prediction - Interconnect** | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/t-zanin/projeto-churn-interconnect/) | Python (Scikit-learn)| This project was developed as part of a final sprint to predict customer churn for the telecommunications provider Interconnect. The task involved analyzing customer personal data, plans, and contracts to identify churn patterns and create a machine learning model. The goal is to provide insights that allow the company to offer promotional codes and special plans to retain at-risk customers. The dataset includes information on contracts, personal data, internet, and phone services.|
| **Megaline Telecom Revenue Analysis** | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/t-zanin/DS-megaline) | Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy (for statistical tests))| This project analyzes customer behavior and revenue generation for Megaline, a telecommunications company offering two prepaid plans: Surf and Ultimate. The goal is to determine which plan generates more revenue to optimize the company’s advertising budget. Based on a sample of 500 customers, the analysis examines call, text, and data usage patterns in 2018 to identify revenue trends and provide actionable insights.|
| **Game Sales Analysis - Ice Project** | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/t-zanin/DS-ICE) | Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib,SciPy)| This project was developed for a data analysis learning sprint. The goal is to analyze historical video game sales data from the Ice online store, which sells games globally, to identify patterns that determine a game's success.|
